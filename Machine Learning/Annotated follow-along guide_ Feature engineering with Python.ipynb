    "Feature selection is the process of choosing features to be used for modeling. In practice, feature selection takes place at multiple points in the PACE process. Although sometimes you will be given a dataset and a defined target variable, most often in practice you will begin with only a question or a problem that you are tasked with solving. In these cases, if you decide that the problem requires a model, you'll then have to:\n",

    "Then, during the **Analyze** phase, you would perform EDA on the data and reevaluate your variables for appropriateness. For example, can your model handle null values? If not, what do you do with features with a lot of nulls? Perhaps you drop them. This too is feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it doesn't end there. Feature selection also occurs during the **Construct** phase. This usually involves building a model, examining which features are most predictive, and then removing the unpredictive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of work involved in feature selection. In our case, we already have a dataset, and we're not performing thorough EDA on it. But we can still examine the data to ensure that all the features can reasonably be expected to have predictive potential. \n"
