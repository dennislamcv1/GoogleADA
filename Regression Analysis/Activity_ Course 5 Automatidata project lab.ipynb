Their newest client, the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), wants the Automatidata team to build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year. The team is getting closer to completing the project, having completed an initial plan of action, initial Python coding work, EDA, and A/B testing.\n",

    "In this activity, you will build a multiple linear regression model. As you've learned, multiple linear regression helps you estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed. \n",
