With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.\n",

    "The TikTok team has reviewed the results of the hypothesis testing. TikTokâ€™s Operations Lead, Maika Abadi, is interested in how different variables are associated with whether a user is verified. Earlier, the data team observed that if a user is verified, they are much more likely to post opinions. Now, the data team has decided to explore how to predict verified status to help them understand how video characteristics relate to verified users. Therefore, you have been asked to conduct a logistic regression using verified status as the outcome variable. The results may be used to inform the final model related to predicting whether a video is a claim vs an opinion.\n",
