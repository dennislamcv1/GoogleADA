Sylvester tells your team about a new request from leadership: to analyze the relationship between mean amount of rides and device type. You also discover follow-up emails from three other team members: May Santner, Chidi Ga, and Harriet Hadzic. These emails discuss the details of the analysis. They would like a statistical analysis of ride data based on device type. In particular, leadership wants to know if there is a statistically significant difference in mean amount of rides between iPhone® users and Android™ users. A final email from Chidi includes your specific assignment: to conduct a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone users and Android users.\n",
