    "Even with small sample sizes, the variation within the data is enough to allow you to make statistically significant conclusions. You identified with 95% confidence that the Los Angeles mean AQI was stastitically different from the rest of California, and that New York does have a lower mean AQI than Ohio. However, you were unable to conclude with 95% confidence that Michigan's mean AQI was below 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each test, you would present the null and alternative hypothesis, then describe your conclusion and the resulting p-value that drove that conclusion. As the setup of t-test's have a few key configurations that dictate how you interpret the result, you would specify the type of test you chose, whether that tail was one-tail or two-tailed, and how you performed the t-test from `stats`.\n",

    "**What would you convey to external stakeholders?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In answer to the research questions posed, you would convey the degree of confidence (95%) and your conclusion. Additionally, providing the sample statistics being compared in each case will likely provide important context for stakeholders to quickly understand the difference between your results.\n"
