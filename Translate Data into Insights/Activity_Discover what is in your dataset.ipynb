    "In this activity, you will discover characteristics of a dataset and use visualizations to analyze the data. This will develop and strengthen your skills in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and your knowledge of functions that allow you to explore and visualize data. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is an essential process in a data science workflow. As a data professional, you will need to conduct this process to better understand the data at hand and determine how it can be used to solve the problem you want to address. This activity will give you an opportunity to practice that process and prepare you for EDA in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you are a member of an analytics team that provides insights to an investing firm. To help them decide which companies to invest in next, the firm wants insights into **unicorn companies**â€“companies that are valued at over one billion dollars. The data you will use for this task provides information on over 1,000 unicorn companies, including their industry, country, year founded, and select investors. You will use this information to gain insights into how and when companies reach this prestigious milestone and to make recommentations for next steps to the investing firm."
